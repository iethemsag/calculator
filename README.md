HTML Structure:
HTML forms the structure of your web page. We will use HTML to create the interface of the calculator.
<input> element: Represents the text input field where users can see calculations and results.
<button> elements: Will be used for digits, operations, and the equals button for performing calculations.
CSS Style Sheet (style.css):
CSS controls the appearance and layout of HTML elements.
.calculator: Defines the overall style of the calculator's main box.
button: Specifies the appearance of buttons, including their size and spacing.
JavaScript Code (script.js):
JavaScript is used for performing calculations and interacting with the user.
displayValue: Text used to display user input and results.
appendToDisplay(value): Updates the input text based on the buttons clicked by the user.
clearDisplay(): Clears and resets the input text.
calculate(): Evaluates the user's input expression to perform calculations and displays the result.
These three components form the fundamental structure of the calculator's functionality. The Java code is used to calculate the user's input and show the result. HTML creates the user interface, while CSS defines the layout and style of that interface.

You can expand this basic structure and add more features. For example, you could incorporate additional mathematical operations, display a history of calculations, or provide different theme options. To further enhance this project, you can unleash your creativity.
